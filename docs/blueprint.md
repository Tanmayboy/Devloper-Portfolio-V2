## Style Guidelines:

- Background: Desaturated blue-gray (#2C3E50) to provide a professional backdrop. This choice pulls from the concepts of professionalism, cleanliness, and technology implied by the prompt; this choice is suitable for a dark color scheme.
- Primary color: Soft, muted cyan (#A7CBCF) for highlighting key elements. This is analogous to the background hue, with the higher brightness and saturation allowing it to stand out.
- Accent color: Pale yellow (#EAE394) for interactive elements and call-to-actions. This is a yellow-greenish color which, while still analogous to the primary, sets itself apart by means of higher brightness.
- Font pairing: 'Space Grotesk' (sans-serif) for headlines and 'Inter' (sans-serif) for body text.
- Use a set of minimalist line icons to represent skills, technologies, and social media links.
- Implement a clean, responsive grid layout with subtle spacing and padding for a modern look.
- Employ subtle animations and transitions (e.g., fade-in, slide-up) when sections load, combined with smooth parallax scrolling.
